* Algo Design w/ scikit-learn

To Do List
- [x] write basic algorithm, sum of term frequency
    - frequency based on all phrases
- [x] write tfidf clustering method 
    - repurpose for flexibility
- [x] write counter vectorizer clustering method
- [x] write method to score responses by frequency
    - number of responses in a cluster/number of total responses subtracted from 1
    - subtract from 1 to get the reverse mapping
- [x] experiment with a greater cluster size
- [x] update stop words list to include "use" and "thing"
- [ ] figure out how many times to run kmeans
    - cross validation
    - then averaging the results of all the iterations
